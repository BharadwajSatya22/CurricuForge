Here’s a clear, step-by-step explanation of the **virtual environment process** you went through while building your Curriculum Designer app.

This is exactly what happened on your Windows machine (C:\Users\Lenovo\curriculum-designer-bot), and why each step was necessary.

### Step-by-step: What you did and why

1. **Created the project folder**  
   Command:
   ```
   mkdir curriculum-designer-bot
   cd curriculum-designer-bot
   ```

   → This creates a clean directory where all your project files (code, venv, etc.) will live.  
   Keeps everything organized and separate from other Python projects.

2. **Created a virtual environment inside the project folder**  
   Command:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   → This creates a folder named `venv` that contains an isolated Python installation (python.exe, pip, site-packages, etc.).  
   Why? So packages you install (like streamlit, google-generativeai) are **only for this project** — they don’t pollute your global/system Python.

3. **Activated the virtual environment**  
   Command (Windows Command Prompt):
   ```
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```

   → After running this, your prompt changes to:
   ```
   (venv) C:\Users\Lenovo\curriculum-designer-bot>
   ```

   → This means you’re now “inside” the venv.  
   Any `pip install` or `python` command now uses the isolated Python/pip from the `venv` folder — not your global one.


4. **Installed required packages inside the venv**  
   Commands:
   ```
   pip install streamlit google-generativeai
   pip install reportlab

   ```

   → These packages are now installed **only inside the venv** folder (you can see them in `venv\Lib\site-packages`).  
   Your global Python still doesn’t have them → this keeps your system clean.

5. **Ran the app using the venv’s Python**  
   Command:
   ```
   python -m streamlit run app.py
   ```

   → Using `python -m` (instead of just `streamlit run`) ensures it uses the **venv’s** Python interpreter (the one with your packages).  
   This was very important because earlier your global `streamlit` command was trying to run with the global Python (which didn’t have google-generativeai → ImportError).

6. **Deactivated when finished** (optional)  
   Command:
   ```
   deactivate
   ```

   → Returns your terminal back to global Python (prompt loses `(venv)`).  
   You can reactivate anytime with `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`.

### Summary Table – What each part does

| Step | Command | What it does | Why we needed it |
|------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Create folder | `mkdir ...` | Makes project directory | Organization |
| Create venv | `python -m venv venv` | Makes isolated Python folder | Prevent global pollution |
| Activate venv | `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` | Switches terminal to use venv’s Python/pip | Installs packages only here |
| Install packages | `pip install ...` | Downloads libraries into venv | App can use streamlit + Gemini |
| Run app | `python -m streamlit run app.py` | Uses venv’s Python to launch | Avoids global Python errors |
| Deactivate | `deactivate` | Returns to normal terminal | Good practice when done |

### Quick recap – how to start fresh next time

```bash
cd C:\Users\Lenovo\curriculum-designer-bot
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
streamlit run app.py
```
